PyNE: The Nuclear Engineering Toolkit
=====================================
The PyNE project aims to provide a common set of tools for nuclear 
science and engineering needs.

If you are interested in the package itself, or would like to help
and contribute, please let us know either on the mailing list 
(https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pyne-dev, 
pyne-dev@googlegroups.com) or `github`_.

Examples, documentation, and more can be found at 
http://pyne.io/, the official PyNE projectsite.

Installation

-------------
Dependencies
-------------
PyNE has the following dependencies:

   #. `CMake <http://www.cmake.org/>`_ (>= 2.8.5)
   #. `NumPy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_ (>= 1.8.0)
   #. `SciPy <http://www.scipy.org/>`_
   #. `Cython <http://cython.org/>`_ (>= 0.19.1)
   #. `HDF5 <http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/>`_
   #. `PyTables <http://www.pytables.org/>`_
   #. `Python 2.7 <http://www.python.org/>`_

Additionally, building the documentation requires the following:

   #. `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`_
   #. `SciSphinx <https://github.com/numfocus/scisphinx>`_
   #. `breathe <http://michaeljones.github.io/breathe/>`_ 
   #. `PrettyTable <https://code.google.com/p/prettytable/>`_

Binary
------
A binary distribution of PyNE is currently available for windows only on 
32-bit python using conda. In order to install use the following command::

    conda install -c https://conda.binstar.org/batesca pyne_win32py27

Conda binaries are coming soon for other platforms.

.. _install_source:

------
Source
------
Installing PyNE from source is a two-step process.  First, download and 
unzip the source (`zip`_, `tar`_).  Then run the following commands from 
the unzipped directory::

    cd pyne/
    python setup.py install --user
    scripts/nuc_data_make

The ``setup.py`` command compiles and installs the PyNE source code.
The ``nuc_data_make`` builds and installs a database of nuclear data.
Unfortunately, this must be done as a second step because most nuclear 
data is under some form of license restriction or export control which 
prevents the developers from distributing it with PyNE.  However, the 
``nuc_data_make`` program (which is installed by ``setup.py``) will
do its best to find relevant nuclear data elsewhere on your machine
or from public sources on the internet.  

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Conda Install Instructions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
On mac and linux PyNE can be installed via the package manager conda. 
After installing anaconda or miniconda from 
`the Continuum downloads page <http://continuum.io/downloads>`_ 
add conda's binary directory to your bash profile by adding::

    export PATH=/path/to/anaconda/bin:$PATH

to your .bashrc or .bash_profile. Then in a new shell::

    conda install conda-build jinja2 nose setuptools pytables hdf5 scipy

on linux you may also need to run::

    conda install patchelf

Then dowload the latest conda-recipes `here 
<https://github.com/conda/conda-recipes/archive/master.zip>`_

cd to the conda-recipes directory and run::

    conda build pyne
    conda install $(conda build --output pyne)
    nuc_data_make

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Mac OSX Specific Instructions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
These instructions are based on using the homebrew http://brew.sh/ package manager
Install command line tools from https://developer.apple.com/downloads/
you will need to create an account in order to download::

    ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go/install)"
    brew doctor
    brew tap homebrew/science
    brew install hdf5
    brew install cmake
    brew install python

Add::

    export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
    export PATH=/usr/local/share/python:$PATH

to ~/.bash_profile, then::

    source ~/.bash_profile
    sudo pip install numpy
    sudo chown -R $(whoami) /usr/local
    brew install gfortran
    pip install scipy
    pip install cython
    pip install numexpr
    pip install tables

download pyne-staging cd to that directory::

    cd Downloads/pyne-staging
    python setup.py install


Once those lines have been added, run the following command before running 
``nuc_data_make``::

    source ~/.bashrc


.. _zip: https://github.com/pyne/pyne/zipball/0.3
.. _tar: https://github.com/pyne/pyne/tarball/0.3

.. install-end
